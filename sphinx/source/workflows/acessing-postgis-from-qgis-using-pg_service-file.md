# Accessing PostGIS from QGIS using a pg_service file

This workflow will demonstrate the following:

* Setting up your Postgres connection
* Loading data into the Postgres database
* Creating the connection
* Creating the pg_service file
* Using the pg_service file on the client side of the stack (where it references the external port) and the server side (where it references the internal port)
